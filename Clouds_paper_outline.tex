\section{Introduction}
Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) were first observed as dark regions
silhouetted against the mid-infrared (MIR) background
\citep{Wilcock2011}. Subsequent observations showed them to have low
temperatures and high densities ($T\lesim$\,K, $n_H > 10^5$\,cm$^-3$,
e.g.~\citet{Egan98,Carey98,HennebellePerault02}). The IRDC absorbs the
background light and causes a dip in the MIR sky brightness. They are
thought to be the earliest observable formation stages high-mass stars
and stellar clusters.

With MIR data alone, however, it is impossible to distinguish this
absorption from a region of inherently lower background
emission. Far-Infared (FIR) observations allow IRDCs, which appear
bright at wavelengths above 24\,\mic, to be distinguished from regions
of lower emission, which remain dark.
